In the kitchen, she [makes] a cup of coffee and [reads] the newspaper. After [breakfast], she [gets] dressed and [leaves] the house at seven thirty. She always [takes] the bus to work because she enjoys [watching] the city [wake] up around her."

Our [special] tonight is grilled salmon with lemon [butter] sauce. Can I [start] you off with something to [drink]? — We'd like a [bottle] of sparkling water, please. And could we have a few more [minutes] to look at the menu?"

The city was [absolutely] breathtaking — the [mixture] of ancient temples and [modern] skyscrapers was unlike anything we had ever [seen]. We [visited] Mount Fuji on our third day and [took] hundreds of photographs. The [experience] changed the way I [think] about the world."

Experts [believe] that within the next two [decades], self-driving cars will be [common] on our roads. However, many people [worry] about the impact of [automation] on [employment]. It is [crucial] that governments and [companies] work together to [prepare] workers for these dramatic [changes]."

Rising [temperatures] are causing glaciers to [melt] and sea [levels] to rise, [threatening] coastal communities around the world. Scientists [warn] that we must [reduce] carbon [emissions] by at least fifty percent within the next ten [years] to avoid the worst [consequences]. Small [actions], such as [recycling], using public [transport], and saving [energy], can make a big [difference] when millions of people [participate]."
